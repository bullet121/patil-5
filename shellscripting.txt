10)Write shell script for identifying the entered number is positive, negative or zero
using if-then-elif structure. Make the program interactive.

nano check.sh ---------- create the file and paste the code in it
chmod +x check.sh ---------- to make file executable
./check.sh --------------- to run that file

code-
#!/bin/bash

# Interactive input
echo "Enter a number:"
read num

# Check if number is positive, negative or zero
if [ $num -gt 0 ]
then
    echo "The number $num is Positive."
elif [ $num -lt 0 ]
then
    echo "The number $num is Negative."
else
    echo "The number is Zero."
fi

11 Write shell script for identifying the entered number is single digit, double digit, three
digit or four digit number using case structure. Make the program interactive.


code -
#!/bin/bash

# Interactive input
echo "Enter a number:"
read num

# Remove any negative sign for digit count
abs_num=${num#-}

# Get number of digits using length
digit_count=${#abs_num}

# Use case structure
case $digit_count in
    1)
        echo "The number $num is a Single Digit number."
        ;;
    2)
        echo "The number $num is a Double Digit number."
        ;;
    3)
        echo "The number $num is a Three Digit number."
        ;;
    4)
        echo "The number $num is a Four Digit number."
        ;;
    *)
        echo "The number $num has more than Four Digits."
        ;;
esac


12 Write a shell script to create a directory. Program should ask the directory name.
Make a provision to check the same directory exists or not? If exist display a message
else create the directory.

code-
#!/bin/bash

# Ask for directory name
echo "Enter the name of the directory to create:"
read dirname

# Check if directory already exists
if [ -d "$dirname" ]; then
    echo "Directory '$dirname' already exists."
else
    mkdir "$dirname"
    echo "Directory '$dirname' created successfully."
fi


13 Write a shell script to calculate factorial of a number using for loop

code-

#!/bin/bash

# Ask user to enter a number
echo "Enter a number:"
read num

# Initialize factorial to 1
fact=1

# Check if number is zero or positive
if [ $num -lt 0 ]; then
    echo "Factorial is not defined for negative numbers."
else
    for (( i=1; i<=num; i++ ))
    do
        fact=$((fact * i))
    done
    echo "Factorial of $num is: $fact"
fi


14 Write a shell script to calculate factorial of a number using while loop.

code-
#!/bin/bash

# Ask user to enter a number
echo "Enter a number:"
read num

# Initialize factorial and counter
fact=1
i=1

# Check for negative input
if [ $num -lt 0 ]; then
    echo "Factorial is not defined for negative numbers."
else
    while [ $i -le $num ]
    do
        fact=$((fact * i))
        i=$((i + 1))
    done
    echo "Factorial of $num is: $fact"
fi


15 Write shell script program for login details such as
for listing all the user accounts name
for counting the number of logged-in user accounts
for listing the names of currently logged-in users
for checking the groups to which the current user belong

code-
#!/bin/bash

echo "====== LOGIN DETAILS SCRIPT ======"

# 1. Listing all user account names
echo -e "\n1. All user account names:"
cut -d: -f1 /etc/passwd

# 2. Counting number of logged-in user accounts
echo -e "\n2. Number of logged-in user accounts:"
who | cut -d' ' -f1 | sort | uniq | wc -l

# 3. Listing names of currently logged-in users
echo -e "\n3. Currently logged-in users:"
who | cut -d' ' -f1 | sort | uniq

# 4. Checking groups of current user
echo -e "\n4. Groups to which current user ($USER) belongs:"
groups


16 Write a shell script to show various system configuration like currently logged user
and his login name, your current shell, home directory, operating system type, current
path setting, current working directory.

code-

#!/bin/bash

echo "====== SYSTEM CONFIGURATION DETAILS ======"

# Currently logged user
echo -e "\n1. Currently logged-in user:"
whoami

# Login name
echo -e "\n2. Login name:"
logname

# Current shell
echo -e "\n3. Current shell:"
echo $SHELL

# Home directory
echo -e "\n4. Home directory:"
echo $HOME

# Operating system type
echo -e "\n5. Operating system type:"
uname -o

# Current PATH setting
echo -e "\n6. Current PATH setting:"
echo $PATH

# Current working directory
echo -e "\n7. Current working directory:"
pwd
